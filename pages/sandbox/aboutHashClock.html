    <h1>Hash Clock Explanation</h1>
    <p>Recently, I've been obsessed with the idea of hashing and am amazed at the complete 
        randomness of it. There are tons of hashing algorithims but since SHA256 is the most
        common, I used that.
    </p>
    <p> These algorithims take any string as an input and then converts that into a hash of 
        consistant length, in this case 64 characters, regardless of how long the input is.
        Hashes are also deterministic, the same input will always give the same output. this
        is extremely useful in security since it can be used to compare 2 strings without doing
        so directly.
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>But why?</summary>
        <p>Let's say a website wants to have password security. The most obvious solution is to
            have the user send their password to the server and then compare it to the stored password.
            But, if someone intercepts that text they then have the user's password, no good.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hashes are used instead, because it is currently impossible to go from a hash to the 
            message that was run through the algorithm. The hashes are stored instead and checked against.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Example, if your password is "password123" then its SHA256 will always be
            "EF92B778BAFE771E89245B89ECBC08A44A4E166C06659911881F383D4473E94F".
        </p>
        <p>This is the value stored by the server.</p>
        <p>
            When logging in, instead of sending your password to the server directly your browser sends the hash
            of the password. If the two match, you are logged in. If there is any difference, then we know the 
            value is incorrect. We don't know how or why it is incorrect. Just that it is.
        </p>
    </details>
    <p>
        The clock itself, while not bery useful for telling time, is good at coming up with completely random colors.
        Each row represents the hash of a time string (for example "Mon Mar 03 2025 14:12:11 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)")
    </p>    
    <p>    
        Hex codes for colors are made of 6 characters, so I divide the hash into strings of 6 characters. So every second,
        we get a new random color set. All thats left is 4 characters that I haven't figured out what to do with yet.
    </p>
